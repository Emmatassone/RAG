{"Info": ["Green hydrogen is hydrogen gas produced through renewable energy sources, like wind or solar power, by using a process called electrolysis. This method splits water into hydrogen and oxygen without generating carbon emissions, making it environmentally friendly.", "Blockchain is a digital ledger technology that stores information across a distributed network of computers. It is secure, transparent, and cannot be easily altered. Each transaction on a blockchain is recorded in blocks and linked (or 'chained') to previous transactions, ensuring a clear and tamper-proof history.", "Blockchain provides a transparent and tamper-proof way to track the production and distribution of green hydrogen. It ensures that every step in the supply chain, from production to delivery, is recorded, giving consumers and regulators confidence in the hydrogen\u2019s green credentials.", "The smart contract on the blockchain records key information about each stage of green hydrogen production and distribution, such as: the source of renewable energy used for production, the quantity of hydrogen produced, and the locations and companies involved in transportation and storage. This data is stored securely and can be verified by anyone, ensuring transparency in the hydrogen supply chain.", "A smart contract is a self-executing program on the blockchain that automatically enforces agreements once the predetermined conditions are met. For tracing green hydrogen, the contract ensures that data about each production stage is securely recorded without needing a middleman.", "Blockchain ensures data integrity by making it immutable (unchangeable). Once a transaction is recorded, it cannot be altered without the consensus of the entire network, making it nearly impossible to falsify information.", "You can access the blockchain using a blockchain explorer, which allows you to see all transactions related to green hydrogen. The blockchain explorer for Polygon, for instance, provides an interface to view the production and distribution history in real time.", "Polygon is a blockchain network designed to be faster and cheaper than other popular blockchains like Ethereum. It allows us to deploy smart contracts and track green hydrogen in a cost-efficient and scalable way, without compromising on security.", "No, you don\u2019t need to understand the technical details of blockchain to use the system. The contract\u2019s functionality is designed to be user-friendly, providing an easy way to verify the sustainability of green hydrogen without requiring blockchain knowledge.", "By using blockchain, we ensure that the production of green hydrogen is transparent, encouraging accountability and reducing fraud in the sustainability claims. This helps promote genuine green energy initiatives, contributing to the fight against climate change."]}
